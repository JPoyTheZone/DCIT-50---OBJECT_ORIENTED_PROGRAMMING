This project's intended use is to demonstrate the pillar of OOP, inheritance. 

Inheritance as it names suggests, is the ability of classes to inherit a parent class capabilities and all. The members and methods of the parent class is inherited by using the keyword "Inherits" in the class.

In this project heirarchical inheritance is demonstrated.

There are 3 classes which demonstrates heirarchical inheritance:
  Person
  Teacher 
  Student

Teacher inherits Person
Student inherits from Person as well.

Although they inherit from the same class, they are still different on a local scale since they are parallel to one another.
