This project's intended use is to demonstrate the concept of class and objects in Java.

Classes are the blueprints of what would be known as objects. Since classes are blueprints, they are what we may call uninstantiated,
since they aren't initialised and does not carry any modifiable members yet on runtime.

Classes found in project are:
  Book
  MyBookList (main)

Objects are the instantiated members of the class. They are created on compilation of the main method, when you initialized an 
object with the main method, they will be created upon compilation and therefore can be accessed on runtime.

Methods are what can be called "snippets" of code that can be reused. The concept of methods allows you to execute multiple lines 
of code by calling them (method). This allows you to run the code multiple times in a single object, run it at multiple but varying 
number of times as needed compared to other objects of same class, and access and edit the members of the class from outside the class without 
having to explicitly call the member itself. 

The Book Class has methods:
  changePage(int Target_Page)
  ChangeAuthor(String Author)
  ChangeTitle(String Title)
  yearPublished(int yearPublished)



Alot of concepts like the Four Pillars of Object Oriented Programming, builds up on classes, objects and methods' implementation and
interaction.
